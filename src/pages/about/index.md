I am a passionate, independent learner with a talent for writing clean, maintainable code and building elegant user experiences. My extensive background as a [professional violinist](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=USPusTK9mYU) and an [entrepreneur](http://kaitlinjane.com) has given me the skills to solve complex problems and perform under pressure. I am currently working as a [software developer](http://deciphernow.com/staff/kaitlin-moreno) at [Decipher Technology Studios](http://deciphernow.com) in Alexandria, VA, where I'm building UI's for Decipher's flagship product, Grey Matter, as well as an [open source UI component library](https://github.com/DecipherNow/gm-ui-components/) to support projects across the company.

Although I work in tech full time I am still active in the DC arts community. [rogue collective](http://roguecollectivedc.com), founded in 2014, is a string ensemble that focuses on interdisciplinary collaboration and improvisation and performs regularly in the DMV area. I also photograph weddings and portraits through my photography business, [Kaitlin Jane Photography](http://kaitlinjane.com).
