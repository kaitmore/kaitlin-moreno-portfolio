I am a passionate, independent learner with a talent for writing clean, maintainable code and building elegant user experiences. My background as a [professional violinist](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=USPusTK9mYU), [collaborator](http://roguecollectivedc.com) and [entrepreneur](http://kaitlinjane.com) has given me the skills to bring creative solutions to hard problems. I am currently working as a software engineer at [Decipher Technology Studios](http://greymatter.io) where I'm leading a team that builds the Grey Matter intelligent service mesh platform.

I'm currently living in the Asheville, NC area on a homestead with my fiance, two kitties, and various adorable farm animals. In my spare time I like to cook delicious food, go kayaking, and play video games :)
